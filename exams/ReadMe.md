# Past exams

In this folder you'll find past midterms and final exams.

:warning: Please note that:
- The material taught this year may not be the same, or in the same order, as previous years;
  thus, you may not be able to (nor expected to) finish previous exams.
- They were originally published in repositories the staff created for each student;
  when an exam tells you to "push to this repository", you should [create a fork of this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) and push to your fork instead.
